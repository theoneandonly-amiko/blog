            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Well, interesting question. Normally I'll say I'm just a normal person. But deep down, I am more than just normal. Have a lot of passions, I should say. Currently, I spend most of my time to work, and in my free time, I maintain my Discord bot called LunaðŸŒ™. Other time I just do normal stuffs.</p>
            
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I work as the service staff in a chicken restaurant. That's my daily main job. I also code, not quite often because I have visual issue with my sore eyes. Aside from that, I also love reading books, listening and making music, hanging out.</p>
            
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>You can find me in Discord, the platform I always be active! @luna_starry is my username there.</p>
            <p>You can also reach me via email: fbound899@gmail.com, but just don't expect replies, as I rarely check mails. ðŸ˜…</p>
